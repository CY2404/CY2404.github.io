Hello, I'm Cheril Yogi, a forward-thinking graduate student pursuing Master of Science in Information Systems at Northeastern University in Boston, MA, with an anticipated graduation in May 2024. With a robust foundation in programming languages such as Python, Java, and C++, coupled with hands-on experience in orchestrating data projects and leveraging cloud technologies, I am passionate about exploring the frontiers of data science and machine learning. My journey includes impactful roles, such as a Project Coordinator at Nath Power Solution, where I spearheaded the implementation of innovative data pipelines and machine learning algorithms for solar power efficiency. As I navigate the dynamic landscape of data, I am excited about contributing my expertise and learning from every opportunity that comes my way.
