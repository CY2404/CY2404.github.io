#### Blog Post 3: Causal Inference using Propensity Score

This post delves into the concept of causal inference, explaining its significance in understanding cause-and-effect relationships between variables. It distinguishes causal inference from correlation analysis, emphasizing the need to identify and control for confounding factors. The article explores the correlation vs causation debate and highlights the application of causal inference in various fields, including healthcare and business. Additionally, it draws connections between reinforcement learning and causality in machine learning, presenting different methods for performing causal inference and providing a detailed worked example using the "Play Tennis" dataset to estimate the causal effect of weather conditions on playing tennis.
